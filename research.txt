How to Write a Research Report
If you’re having trouble writing your research report, you’ve come to the right place. There are many points one needs to consider when writing a research report. But to keep this short, here are the basic things you need to know:
•	Decide what type of report to present, and its purpose.
•	Identify your objectives. What will you accomplish in writing the report? What is the purpose of your report?
•	Know your audience. Who will read your report? What do they need to know? What do you want them to know?
•	Create a list of information you want to include in your research report.
•	Gather the facts and data necessary for your reporting a issue.
•	Organize your report. As mentioned earlier, you can create sections to breakdown your ideas into more understandable ones.
•	Write the content. Write everything, especially the executive summary. Make sure to write it simply and clearly for your readers to understand (as I always say).
•	You may use graphic symbols to present significant data (e.g. quantitative, comparative, etc).
•	Proofread your report. The last but definitely not the least one. You need to check for possible mistakes or errors on spelling, grammar, and information. Though I suggest you ask someone else to proofread your work for you.
