Heterogeneity,scale,timeliness,complexity,andprivacyproblemswithBigDataimpede
progressatallphasesofthepipelinethatcancreatevaluefromdata.Theproblemsstartrightaway
duringdataacquisition,whenthedatatsunamirequiresustomakedecisions,currentlyinanadhoc
manner,aboutwhatdatatokeepandwhattodiscard,andhowtostorewhatwekeepreliablywiththe
rightmetadata.Muchdatatodayisnotnativelyinstructuredformat;forexample,tweetsandblogsare
weaklystructuredpiecesoftext,whileimagesandvideoarestructuredforstorageanddisplay,butnot
forsemanticcontentandsearch:transformingsuchcontentintoastructuredformatforlateranalysisis
amajorchallenge.
